```{r set-up, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,

```

# Getting started

1. Clone your repo `appex04-[github_name]` to create a new project
   in RStudio Cloud under the STA 199 class space.

2. Configure git
      ```{r config-git-ex, eval=FALSE}
      library(usethis)
      use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
      ```

# Packages and Data

We'll make use of the following packages.

```{r load-packages}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

There are two data files we will use: `world.shp`, `coronavirus.shp`. We'll
read each of these in with function `st_read()` and save them as `world` and
`virus`.

```{r}
world <- st_read("data/world.shp", quiet = TRUE)
virus <- st_read("data/coronavirus.shp", quiet = TRUE)
```

# Tasks

## Task 1

Take a look at objects `world` and `virus`. How many fields exist for each
object? What type of geometry is associated with each `sf` object?

```{r task-1-world}
world
```

```{r task-1-virus}
virus
```

## Task 2

#### Part 1

Use object `world` to create a world map of the countries. You'll want to use
functions `ggplot()` and `geom_sf()`.

```{r task-2-p1}

```

#### Part 2

Build on your map from Part 1 so that the countries have a fill color 
associated with the population estimate. Variable `pop_est` is in millions.
Be sure to label your map.

```{r task-2-p2}

```

## Task 3

Filter `world` for the country "China". Save the result as `china`.

```{r task-3-china}
china <- world %>% 
  filter(name == "China")
```

Next, we'll filter object `virus` for confirmed cases in China and save the
result as `china_cv`. The code is given below.

```{r task-3-china-cv}
china_cv <- virus %>% 
  filter(cntry_r == "Mainland China", !is.na(confrmd))
```

- `cntry_r == "Mainland China"` filters rows so we only keep information on
  China
  
- `!is.na(confrmd)` filters rows for where there is not a missing confirmed
  case of coronavirus

## Task 4

Use the template provided to overlay the point locations of the coronavirus
in China with a map of China. Have the size of the points reflect the
number of confirmed cases. Refer to slides 31-32 as a guide.

```{r task-4, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = china) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#DE2910")
```

*Hints:*

- you'll need another `geom_sf()` layer
- set point colors as `color = "#FFDE00"`
- inside this second `geom_sf()` include `show.legend = "point"` to have the 
  legend show points rather than squares
